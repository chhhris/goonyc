Subject: whoa, weird
To: <A girl (friend of Kate Greathead) who works in publishing>


whoa--that i should reach out three times (two voicemails and one email) in one night after so many nights of nil;
why, what--that this should be our last communique?

weird--that a poem so weird should be so personal? true, this poem is deadly personal; so much so that i dared not share it with you whilst i still felt intimidated by you (after our first encounter but not after our second);

wow--please, don't read this or if you do please tell me so;

will--that this should, yet shall not, be the last c.?


well--a poem i've shared with you:


## POEM

"Tonedeaf microphone stallion Stalin on Staten
Flonase(c) deviated no names on satin Manhattan
Sewn undressed stoned wand'ring the islands."


* * *


Tonight rushes at me the dogs straining
and stray cats looking so
cute their eyes cloudy their scabby
heads. The streets of Manhattan

* * *


My hometown is a jungle. All the passengers
in the subway the shuttle across times
square. My jealousy of the drivers
driving cars I want a car. I stare
down the high school girly girls
walking down 96th street
every morning while I'm walking
up 96th street to the six train
to the four five at 86th street.
Every morning

* * *

After I kiss my wife goodbye.
After our morning romp, I attend
the office. My life is my vocation.
Work is not work so much as vacation.

Before the Law School the blue mail box
I mail, a handwritten note, my Mont Blanc penmanship
a swath of satin papier flush in the shimmering gold
embossed Presidential seal of the Dean's approval.

"I'm telling you we bombed their shit
out of them." This old man approached me the one
morning--his gray stubble dignified gone wrong, gone
overgrown silvery weeds across his rough-hewn cheeks
sideburns--though I liked his Mets apparel his New York
orange pizazz

He was a bum. I kissed
the memory of kissing my wife goodbye.
Plans to meet up with my best friend I call him
Diego to everyone else. To me he's my three
legged miracle child. I pay like six or seven hundred
dollars a month to support this, my little slum
Lord baby's mama. I thought the old man was out
of my system

Now he's grabbed me by my throat
Burning me with his cigarette butt on the barnacle
the antler spoke aback my head--his cheap 50 cent
cigar. "You old burns, you," I howl.

"I burns you," he retorts, "you little
maggot!" The old man--he's surely
pushing eighty years old by now
--wrestles me to the pavement. The hordes

of Normandie Court stomp over me. A businessman
picks me up. He introduces himself as a weather
forecaster. "Thanks, man," I mutter. "You better have
more than tips. Lads like me need capital."

I dust myself off.
He checks the label on my tie.
This is Friday. Work, eat, drink
Play basketball early on Saturday with my
high school coach and his buddies. In basketball
my team wins. I see my good friend John Legend
for the first time in months. We connect. I head
to work on a Saturday: prepare everything ahead
of time: I anticipate every little
problem and adjust
accordingly.

* * *

Leadership with speed and accuracy with
compassion for the common man. I note
the change of schedule: next week's poetry
reading at the 92nd Street YMHA. My
Blackberry helps me stay in touch.
I grab the weather forecastor's Blackberry
with lightning quickness and DC
sniper accuracy

I approach the stock market
in the wee hours of the night
armed with adderal, my mom's love
my magician's cunning, my lineage
my fraternizing. After work I met
up with Diego and Joaquin Pheonix
Friday night and accompanied his
entourage through the premier of his latest
flick at the Loew's Cineplex on the New
Forty-Second Street. The cops watch
me I'm molested by clumps of panting
junkyard dogs. The dogs, they could not help

* * *

themselves. I kill four of them
two escape. I hunt them them through the misty
bogs of post-Katrina New Orleans through
Madame Tussaud's wax museum.

* * *

They raped me! Those dogs

I killed them.
They violated my most basic
human rights.

I scored my revenge in the United Nations.
I read about my victory in the newspapers.
I am an ace ambassador.

* * *

Though my bed is scarred and pocked
Though Joaquin's movie was good I fell
asleep. When I arrived home my cats were starving
I would never neglect them. Where is my wife?
"Why didn't she feed you guys?" I ask.

My wife translates the world into terms
I can understand.

"Here you go, sweetie." My wife
emerges from the bathroom wearing
a sexy neglig√©e. She's holding a platter
of freshly baked brownies. I toss them aside

* * *

ravage her

If you think I liked having that old geezer with his blue
plaid flannel Mets cap and gray whiskers and beige teeth
drag me down to the street and pummel me, well

So I suppose it goes without saying that I disliked
having this young hot shot weather man giving me
financial tips in such a condescending fashion like poor
me for thinking that about multi-cap hedge funds

Oh yes, thank you, I actually did know that I'm way too poor
to invest in the stock market. Why don't you take your
capital and stick it up my ass? You selfish soul-less
prick. My farts shall smell like success. Affluence
is an aura. I'm a selfish prick, too, because I want to be rich only
I'm more pathetic because I don't have the business
acumen. I have the IQ but not the savvy. I'm a creative
type pooh bear. The Wall Street junior executive weather
beater brushed me off and moved up the street toward Lex
and around the corner. My thighs and elbows ached
from all the white business people and hispanic school
children and Caribbean nannies who stomped over me
while I was down. That's life

for a shade like me. Riding in the subway
I like to think about where I've been and where
I'm going. Like still living at home with Mom and my
wife. And the child support. You know I picked up

The clues of a successful presentation so at least
middle and poor class people think

I'm rich though I don't pretend to think
I'm fooling the cognoscenti. You know
Mom is a government subsidized single
mother. The 26th floor two bedroom
that I share with Mom and my wife in
Normandie Court is our little perch in the
sky: all praise due to Mitchell Lama.

I'm a skinny little striver. The one
aspect of my personality that's affluent
is that I like to relax and take life easy and smoke
drugs: but then so do poor people. Hell,
that's why they're poor. Hell: I don't believe
in it (even though I've been there: no I haven't).
Hell is here on earth. Heaven? Maybe. I believe in the unexpected
lift, the transcendental, psychedelic drugs and dedicated
meditation, the supernatural, the miraculous, the Horatio
Alger American Dream. I have to or else I have nothing
better in life to look forward to than law school and ninety
hours a week of what? Don't get me wrong: even hippies
and spiritual seekers agree the Law is a fascinating
the Law is a way of life, a mode of inquiry, an ontology,

a dreamweaving backbreaking ball
busting rocketship octopus tree, and the soil!

Trace a finger across my forehead: I'm so oil.
Clearasil clear it right

up. Pro active, Oxy 10, Neutrogena: let's call
that whole bag "high school" because that's when
I had pimples. My dad and mom

were never married: a pimple on both your houses!
Now I only get pimples on my butt. Since no one
sees my butt that's no big deal. In high school
I was so desperate to clear my acne, and so wily,
and so weird, that I smeared ejaculation across
my T-zone. Hoping for some miraculous thing.
Now--I'm not about to spread ejaculate
on my butt, no sir. I've learned
my lessons.

Everyday at work is a new lesson. I'm learning
loads about the human condition, much more than
I learned on my jaunt to Europe this summer,
which turned into a lame bout of sightseeing.

Mykonos is a great place if you're gay, and a great
place if you're straight: it's fun for the whole family.
If I took a large dick up my ass, I must have been
sleepy. I'm not gay I just play gay on TV. It's not
a gay lisp, it's a metal wire glued to the back of my
teeth lisp. That's why I perform tongue

exercises: the correct pronunciation of "cunnilingus."

I love women for their ripe breasts and round asses and pretty
faces and cute smiles and flirtatious ways
and no:never have I created a wholly dimensional female
character. I've only dealt with stereotypes and the objects
of heterosexual male fantasies. I never said I was perfect, though
I did once for a night think I was Jesus. That was the first time I
ever tried acid, freshman year. When will I grow up? Tonight,

on my way home from work, I realized praying to God
"thy will be done" is only a form of reassurance.

If one believes in an omniscient God
with all the philosophical implications
therein, then of course: thy will

will be done whether I pray for it or not: praying
is a form of preparation. Like my friend from high
school Cate Bell we met for pizza at Pintaile's
at 1577 York Avenue at 83rd Street she told me a kid
from her college had a father who worked in the Twin
Towers and his mom was on one of the planes.

* * *

So they both died in one fell swoop. Did God

hate that kid or what? If there is such a thing
as reincarnation and karma, that kid must have
been a real cold bastard in . Not anymore--after
experience such unimaginable tragedy, the kid
the poor kid is beyond reproach--if he didn't kill
himself or become a drug addict or maybe
he did and is: I'm impotent to plumb such

depths. That's an awfully deep dish,
and constitutionally, I've only a middling
appetite. Only especially sensitive souls
like my wife can truly feel another's suffering. I feel
terrible about what happened to the kid, but to me

* * *

he's just another anecdote in my repertoire.

* * *

If I tell you I'm a self
absorbed savage dandy, I fear it
will be bad for the story, insofar
as showing is better than telling.
Yet grade school teaches one that teachers
seek satisfaction in the show and tell,
not the show not told. So where am I?
Entry level. Not-for-profit.
Scrubbing the sidelines
of academia. Socializing; networking.

Did I make it work on time after the old geezer
dropped me and the stockbroker picked me up?
You bet I did, I made it to work long enough to move
forward on a couple projects--but my bosses aren't paying
me enough to take me out of my comfort zone. Soon as I hit
the mid-afternoon wall post-lunch post-pork fried rice I lost all
focus and fooled around with my colleagues, regaling my female
co-workers with sordid tales from my high school days. Clock in
clock out: I'm union. My department can't afford to pay me overtime.
Time is money: my hours are billable. How else am I to be a rich poet?
